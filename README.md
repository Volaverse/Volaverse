# Volaverse

Volaverse has several components:

1) The metaverse (volaverse) : This is based on unity webGL and allows anyone to join instantly using a metamask browser extension. Users are free to walk the world and enter classrooms as students in the MVP. Users can also buy land and build structures (using builder (2)) and conduct classes there.

2) The builder (volabuild) : This is also based on unity webGL and allows users to save 'scenes' using given structures. MVP is limited to pre-added structures but would later be extended for any kind of custom 3-d asset / nft.

3) The marketplace (volastore) : This based on react and allows users to trade volaverse based nfts (lands, wearables, decoration)

-) We are using 'Photon' servers to sync player movements in volaverse
-) We are using 'Agora' for video calling in volaverse
-) We have our own server deployed on 'pythonanywhere' to story scenes for builder
-) Smart contracts were all written on Remix and depoyed on 'Rinkeby' etherchain.
